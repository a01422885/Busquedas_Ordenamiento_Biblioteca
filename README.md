This program is meant to make use of templete classes, template methods and vectors to reuse the search (sequential, transposition, and binary) and sort (quick sort, merge sort, selection, insertion, among others) algorithms. for future algorithms. This program also simulates the data base of a library, in which you can search and sort books by certain attributes in ascending and descending order, thanks to the use of booleans methods that compare the attribute that is required.
